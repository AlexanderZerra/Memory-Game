# **Memory Game**

## **The Pitch**
**Memory games require players to randomly click a squre that shall reveal a photo. then do the same. If the two match up the board shall remove those squares from play allowing the player to continue until the board has been cleared. At a random selection of how the cards are placed the player will have to use memory to remember where cards were placed should they click on one that doesnt match**
