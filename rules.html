  <h1>RULES</h1>
  <p>Welcome to memory game. Rules are quite simple here. Click on a card then click on a second card. If the cards you clicked on MATCH then they shall dissapear and you will get a point. If you click on two cards that dont match they will flip back and you can try again at matching more cards. The game will keep track of all the moves you make. See if you can beat your score :)</p>
